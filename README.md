 <li>Add a relevant <strong>header </strong>as a title for the next section (step 5)</li>

 <li>Display the following html markup code in your page. (Hint: use html entities)</li>

</ol>




&lt;!doctype html&gt;

&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;

&lt;title&gt;<strong>WEB222</strong>&lt;/title&gt;

<strong>   </strong>&lt;script src=<strong>“js/myscript.js”</strong>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

<strong>   </strong>&lt;h2&gt;<strong>Basic HTML5 Document Structure</strong>&lt;/h2&gt;

<strong>   </strong>&lt;p&gt;<strong>This is a paragraph</strong>&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;










“HTML Lists” – list.html:




Update the “HTML Lists” page with the following:

<ol>

 <li>Inside list.html, create any <strong>nested list </strong>with meaningful items using <strong>healthy food, calories and nutrition</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>The nested list should contain at least <strong>one ordered list </strong>and at least <strong>one unordered list. </strong></li>

</ul>




<ol start="2">

 <li>Update the list.html page to include two containers (i.e.: &lt;div&gt;) with unique id values.</li>

</ol>




<ol start="3">

 <li>Add a relevant <strong>header </strong>as a title for the next section (step 4)</li>

 <li>Use the <strong>fruits </strong>array inside the <strong>js </strong>file (js/list.js) to write (using JavaScript) an ordered list containing all the fruit inside the array, (ie:”Apples”,”Oranges”,”Pears”,”Grapes”,”Pineapples”,”Mangos”) to one of your containers in the list.html page. Be sure to write to your container (using JavaScript) <strong>after </strong>the window has completely loaded. The ordered list should look like the image below when complete:</li>

</ol>




<ol start="5">

 <li>Add a relevant <strong>header </strong>as a title for the next section (step 6)</li>

 <li>Use the <strong>directory </strong>array inside the <strong>js </strong>file (js/list.js) to write (using JavaScript) a nested unordered list containing all the files and directories (with their files) inside the array to one of your containers in the list.html page.</li>

</ol>




You will notice that files have the type “<strong>file</strong>” and consist of a “<strong>name</strong>” property, whereas directories have the type “<strong>directory</strong>” and consist of a “<strong>name</strong>” property in addition to an <strong>array of files</strong>. Use these properties to correctly construct your nested unordered list (using JavaScript).




Be sure to write to your container <strong>after </strong>the window has completely loaded (using JavaScript). The nested  unordered list should look like the image below when complete:




<strong>     </strong>

<strong> </strong>




“HTML Tables” – table.html:




Update the “HTML Tables” page with the following:

<ol>

 <li>Inside table.html, create the following two tables, each with a relevant <strong>header </strong>as a title:</li>

</ol>




<ul>

 <li>The <strong>1st table </strong>should be composed of the elements: <strong>&lt;table</strong> <strong>style=”border:1px solid;”&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tr&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;th&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;td&gt; </strong>and <strong>&lt;caption&gt; </strong>with meaningful table contents, i.e.: a table <strong>of your program, courses enrolled, hours of each course etc</strong>.</li>

 <li>The <strong>2nd table </strong>should be composed of the elements: <strong>&lt;table style=”border:1px solid;”&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tr&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;th&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;td&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;thead&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tfoot&gt; </strong>and <strong>&lt;tbody&gt; </strong>with meaningful table contents, i.e.: a table of your favourite personalities, authors, descriptions etc.</li>

 <li>Add a relevant <strong>header </strong>as a title for the next section (step 4)</li>

 <li>Use the <strong>users </strong>array inside the <strong>js </strong>file (js/table.js) to write a complete <strong>3rd table </strong>containing all the users inside the array (and an appropriate header row), to your container in the table.html page.</li>

</ol>







You will notice that users consist of the properties: <strong>first_name</strong>, <strong>last_name</strong>, <strong>age</strong>, and <strong>email</strong>. Use these properties to correctly construct your table (using JavaScript) with the following headers: <strong>First Name</strong>, <strong>Last Name</strong>, <strong>Age </strong>and <strong>Email</strong>. You must also ensure that all email addresses are rendered as a valid “mailto” link and will open as a new message in the user’s default mail client when clicked.

</ol>




<ol start="2">

 <li><strong>Update the image.html page to include an additional container (i.e.: &lt;div&gt;) with a unique id value. </strong></li>

 <li>Add a relevant <strong>header </strong>as a title for the next section (step 4)</li>

</ol>




<ol start="4">

 <li>Use the <strong>images </strong>array inside the <strong>js </strong>file (js/image.js) to write 5 new <strong>&lt;figure&gt; </strong>elements to your container in the image.html page (using JavaScript). You will notice that each image in the array has the following properties: <strong>caption</strong>, <strong>alt </strong>and <strong>url</strong>. Use these properties to correctly construct (using JavaScript) your <strong>&lt;figure&gt; </strong>elements such that each element contains a valid <strong>image </strong>(using <strong>url </strong>and <strong>alt) </strong>as well as a <strong>caption </strong>underneath the image with the message contained within the <strong>caption </strong>property</li>

Use these properties to correctly construct (using JavaScript) your video player with (or without) controls, in the correct dimensions and using the correct source options.
